# Self Directed

This repository contains many samples of the kind of work I've been doing to improve my technical skills, including exercises from textbooks I've read and small projects which I personally came up with and executed.

I welcome and encourage feedback on the content of this repository.

If you were linked here from my resume, thank you for your time in reviewing this material to verify the technical skills I have listed.
