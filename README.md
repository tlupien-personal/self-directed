# Self Directed

This repository contains many samples of the kind of work I've been doing to improve my technical skills, including exercises from textbooks I've read, small projects of my own design, and kaggle machine learning challenge notebooks (all of which score in the top 1/3 at least).

I welcome and encourage feedback on the content of this repository.

If you were linked here from my resume, thank you for your time in reviewing this material to verify the technical skills I have listed.
